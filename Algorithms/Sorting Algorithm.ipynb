    "Uses constant extra space for producing the output (modifies the given array only). It sorts the list only by modiying the order of the elements withtin the list. \n",
    "#### Examples: Insertion Sort & Selection Sort are in-place sorting algorthms\n",
    "they dont use any additional space for sorting the list and a typical implementation of Merge Sort is not in-place also the implementation for counting sort is not in-place sorting algorithm. \n",
