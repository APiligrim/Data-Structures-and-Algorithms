    "1) **Heap Sort:** Heap Sort uses Binary Heap to sort an array in O(nLogn) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Priority Queue:** Priority queues can be efficiently implemented using Binary Heap because it supports insert(), delete() and extractmax(), decreaseKey() operations in **O(logn)** time. Binomoial Heap and Fibonacci Heap are variations of Binary Heap. These variations perform union also efficiently.\n",
